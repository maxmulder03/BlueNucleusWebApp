## My Favorite Books

### [Cracking The Coding Interview - Gayle Laakmann McDowell](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)

A defining book of my early career... It's a big but very concise book that gives you the tools to answer any coding interview question & understand the interview process in a way that will give you a lot of confidence going into any interview.

### [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/)

A classic. A must read book that will help you understand your role as an engineer. I want to work with people who have read this book.

### [Hyper Media Systems (HTMX)](https://hypermedia.systems/)

A little more niche web development book... A difficult part about web development as a new dev is the vast landscape of frameworks, libraries, and tools that have been created, iterated upon, and deprecated based on a long history of problems & solutions in the field. The advantage an engineer with decades of experience has is that they've lived through this history, ran into problems, and watched these problemsget solved in real time.

You, on the other hand, are just jumping into this world & it can be easy to see things and think "I guess this is just how it's done". I'd urge you dig deeper & try to understand the "why".

This book starts with some history about the web, some of the decisions that have been made, and their disagreements with some of those decisions that inspired the creation of frameworks like HTMX.

I personally found a lot of software arguments annoying and pedantic early in my career, but this book is a great example of a worthwhile discussion about how we build software for the web written by people who have invested their time building software to make the web better.
